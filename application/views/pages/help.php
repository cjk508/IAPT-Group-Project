		<h4>Viewing preference</h4>
		<p>Don't worry if you picked a style by accident! You can change
			presentation style at any time, even</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Whole</b> - This presentation style simply displays the recipe
				instructions as a whole block of text.</li>
			<li><b>Segmented</b> - The instructions are separated out into
				several combined steps.</li>
			<li><b>Finely cut</b> - For those who are relatively new to cooking
				or prefer to simply take it step-by-step, the finely cut option
				separates the recipe instructions into clear, easy to follow steps.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Helpful tips:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Search shortcut</b> - To search at any time, you can simply
				press 's' and start searching away for your desired meal.</li>
			<li><b>Instructions</b> - If you don't want to get your
				mouse/trackpad dirty by having to click next, you can use the arrow
				keys or alternatively enable voice control to skip steps by saying
				"next step".</li>
			<li><b>Surprise me</b> - If you're stuck for choice or want to
				challenge yourself to cook something out of your comfort zone, try
				using the Surprise Me ! (link?) function in the navigation bar to
				select a meal at random.</li>
