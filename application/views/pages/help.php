		<h4>Viewing preference</h4>
		<p>Don't worry if you picked a style by accident! You can change
			presentation style at any time through the dropdown at the top of the
			page. The three presentation styles are:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Advanced</b> - This presentation style simply displays the
				recipe instructions as a whole block of text.</li>
			<li><b>Intermediate</b> - The instructions are separated out into
				several combined steps.</li>
			<li><b>Novice</b> - For those who are relatively new to cooking or
				prefer to simply take it step-by-step, the finely cut option
				separates the recipe instructions into clear, easy to follow steps.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Helpful tips:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Search shortcut</b> - To search at any time, you can simply
				press 's' and start searching away for your desired meal.</li>
			<li><b>Instructions</b> - If you don't want to get your
				mouse/trackpad dirty by having to click next, you can use the arrow
				keys or alternatively enable voice control - you can read more about
				that feature below.</li>
			<li><b>Surprise me</b> - If you're stuck for choice or want to
				challenge yourself to cook something out of your comfort zone, try
				using the <i>Surprise Me!</i> function in the navigation bar to
				select a meal at random.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Voice control of recipes:</h4>
		You can change the current step of your recipes through voice control.
		First, you'll need to select either the Intermediate or Novice
		presentation styles - only they can be controlled through voice. After
		that, you'll be able to enable voice control from a button right of
		the recipe title. You can use the following commands to control the
		recipes:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Next</b> - skip a step</li>
			<li><b>Previous</b> - go a step back.</li>
			<li><b>Go to start</b> - go to the first step of the recipe.</li>
		</ul>
