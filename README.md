Interactive Application Programming Techniques Group Assessment
=====

This is a group assessment that followed an Model-View-Controller architecture. It utilises the Bootstrap framework and Annyang for voice recognition. The challenge was to create a cooking related website that provided users with the ability to easily find and follow recipes. The focus of the assessment was on user testing and accessbility. Therefore we endevaoured to conform to WCAG 2.0 standards regarding accessibility. As this was an assessment it was completed in a very restricted deadline therefore the solution is not complete and is very much a prototype.
